# fantasyFootBallCounter
Program to count overall activity from a fantasy football league

I made this for my ESPN fantasy team, if needed I can make one for yahoo.

To use:
Go to an enemy teams home page->translog->set transactions to all->set team to all-> set dates from your draft to now

Highlight and copy all the text from first transaction last. create action.txt in the same folder as the script and paste the activity to action.txt

Run the script
